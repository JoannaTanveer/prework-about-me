      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>HI, I currently work as a GI nurse for Swedish Issaquah Hospital. I have a 6 YO daughter and 2 cats.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Chicago , IL</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy crafting and planning vacations and parties.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be anything where I can use my creativity</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in an apartment in Issaquah</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>My job as a nurse is very hard on the body and spirit, and doesn't make enough money for me (I am newly a single mother) I learned about coding through some friends. I have always been the one at work that knows the most about computers, why not learn how to code and make everyone's life better?</p>
